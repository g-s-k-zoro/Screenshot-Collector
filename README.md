# Screenshot-Collector
Automate the process of getting screenshots of webpages through URLs:

This project uses pyautogui library to automatically capture screenshot and webbrowser library to control opening and closing of web browsers.

Example Usecase: Collection of images of websites to create a data-set.

Note:
For Google Chrome, the xTab extension is required as Chrome by default allows 20 tabs to be open at a time.
			* Ideal setting - maximum 10 tabs, with "Close least recently used tabs" enabled.

*The file URL_list.txt contains the list of URL line by line.
*The Images folder is where the screenshots will be stored.
